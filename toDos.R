# TO DO's

# 1. Check models for convergence. If they don't converge, re-run them without the interaction Cluster:Year [OK] / Fix this module for the data from a table
# 2. Make a module for retrieving Peter's offsets from QPAD for the species and localtions? Check how QPAD works
# 3. Make a module to either get info on proportion of disturbance from an "excel file" or from a module (this would be to either feed glmerBirdModels or predictModule)
# 4. Make a module that will put all data together
# 5. FIx log(birdDensityBCR_Prov_LCC)
# 6. Module for dataUploading (abundance, X, Y, Cluster, YYYY)
