# TO DO:

# If all good, can start the 500m.
# Need to test the new BCR_PROV branch. If working, merge to remodeledOrder
# Then fix all stuff on globalRemodeled
# Then put to run the 500m and hope for the best! ehehehe.
# Need to: 
# 1. Start again the manuscript, at least methods
# 2. Prepare slides for the presentation. When the current 100m are done, 
# I should be able to show the maps in the slides. Focus on what should be the story telling. 
# For that also CHECK my e.mail to myself! Lots of goodies there
